# Escape Velocity

Escape Velocity is a simple Javascript game written in a few days. It originally started as a clone of Tiny Wings as I was rather dissapointed there isn't an Android version :) It then turned into more of a space game thing.

## Current Status

The game is as developed as I am going to develop it for now; so technically 'unmaintained'. I learnt alot about Javascript from it, especially how easy it is for prototyping. If you wish to take this further feel free!
